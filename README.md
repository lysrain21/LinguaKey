## **🔥 What Sets Us Apart**







### **1. Solana Passkey Wallet**





**Your Face Is Your Wallet**

```typescript
// Powered by Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) Secure Element
const wallet = await LinguaSol.create({
  biometric: 'faceID',
  cluster: 'mainnet-beta'
})
```

No passwords. No seed phrases. Just secure, biometric-based access — as natural as unlocking your phone.

### **2. Solana Voice Agent**





**Turn Natural Language into On-Chain Action**

```rust
// “Stake 50 SOL to Jito and auto-compound” ➝ Automatically:
1. Interacts with Jito-Stake
2. Sets up StreamFlow compounding
3. (Optional) Deploys Mango risk hedging
```

▸ Example use cases:



- “List all Mad Lads on Tensor at 30% below floor.”
- “Use 80% of my USDC to LP on Raydium, buy BONK with the rest.”





Your intent, executed — no code, no clicks.



------





### **3. Developer SDK**





**Integrate in Minutes**

```typescript
npm install @linguakit/solana
import { Linguafy } from '@linguakit/solana'

const solanaAgent = new Linguafy({
  connection: new Connection(RPC_ENDPOINT),
  mobile: true, // SMS-optimized transactions
  plugins: [
    '@linguakit/jito',
    '@linguakit/mango'
  ]
})
```

Fast setup. Full control. Expand with ecosystem plugins.
